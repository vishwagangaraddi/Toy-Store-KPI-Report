# ðŸ“Š Toy Store KPI Report

## Project Overview
This project involved building a dynamic Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dashboard in Power BI to analyze the sales performance of a fictitious toy store chain in Mexico. The report provides key metrics and high-level trends to support business decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A fully interactive Power BI report that allows for data exploration and filtering.
- **KPI Cards:** Displays crucial metrics such as total orders, revenue, and profit, with month-over-month trend analysis.
- **Data Modeling:** A clean star schema data model was designed, with one-to-many relationships between sales, products, stores, and calendar tables.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - A bar chart to show orders by product category.
  - A line chart to visualize monthly revenue trends over time.
  - Slicers to filter the report by store location.
- **Data Preparation:** Connected to and profiled four CSV datasets (Sales, Products, Stores, Calendar) with over 829,000 records. Data was cleaned, validated, and transformed to ensure accuracy.
